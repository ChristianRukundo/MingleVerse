# MERN STACK SOCIAL MEDIA APPLICATION
This project is a full-stack social media application that has been developed using the MERN stack. The application includes a registration page that has complete validation, and users can upload their images for their profiles. After registering, users can log in to the application and access the home page. The home page is only accessible to users with a valid token, and those who don't have a token are redirected to the login page.
The home page has a clean design with several widgets that provide information about the current user who is signed in. Users can add a post with a description and an image, and they can edit or delete the image before posting it. Users can see the posts they have created and view the newsfeed of other users' created posts. They can like or dislike a post, view the comments, and even add friends.
The friend list widget is updated automatically when a user adds or removes a friend. The application also has an advertisement widget that displays information about posts with an image. Users can click on a name in the post widget to view the friend or user's profile page.
